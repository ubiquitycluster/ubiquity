# Ubiquity Roadmap

The Ubiquity Roadmap is maintained as a Github project and can be found
[here](https://github.com/orgs/ubiquitycluster/projects/2).

## Description

Each column in the project represents the work items for a specific release of
Ubiquity. In addition there is a `Feature requests` column that contains items 
that have not yet been accepted and the `Backlog` column that contains items 
that have been accepted but not yet planned for a specific release.

An issue can be planned for a specific release if someone volunteers to take
ownership of the feature. The owner will then be assigned the issue. An owner
does not have to carry the whole design and implementation processes on her own
but must instead make sure that the feature is being worked on and will be
completed by the planned release date.

## Proposing a feature

Proposing a new feature for a specific release of one of the components is done
by opening an issue in the Ubiquity repository, describing the feature and
which components and release are targeted. The new issue will automatically
appear in the feature request column of the roadmap.

## Updating the Roadmap

Updating the roadmap is done during a community meeting, with a discussion
within the members of the projects, alternatively through an email thread.
The update is performed by one of the approvers of the Ubiquity project.

A new feature proposal is moved from the `feature requests` column to a
component release column if agreed within the community, and a member
volunteers to take ownership of that feature. If a feature is seen as
necessary in the long-term without being planned for the releases defined,
it is then placed in the `Backlog` column. An issue from the `backlog` can be
moved to a specific release when someone volunteers to take ownership of the
issue.

An inactive issue in one of the releases (marked as stale) can be moved back to
the `Backlog` column, and issues in the `feature requests` column that are not
actual feature proposals but issues related to Ubiquity repository can be
removed from the project.
